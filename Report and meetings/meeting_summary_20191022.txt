Meeting summary 2019.10.22
Due to the difficulty and the uncertain result of using task2vec/model2vec, we change the approach to using two head CNN to visualize computer vision and image captions generated from the model over steps and improve the model base on the observation.
The work is divided into three phases, each phase correspond to each work progress presentation:
Phase 1: finish the two head CNN and implement ¡°prediction difference analysis¡±.
Phase 2: analysis the result, address the problem and design the solution.
Phase 3: visualize the result after implementing the proposed solution.
