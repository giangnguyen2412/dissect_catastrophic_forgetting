# Professor_Comment_on_1st_progress report
- Put reference paper of DeepViz
- Still 3rd type of project
- Baseline solutions: I need to add Fine-tuning approach before we adding any methods 
to defy catastrophic forgetting to see our methods work or not
- Experimental setup is not challenging now, please remove it from presentation

#### next presentation layout ####
# what we have done:
- visualization on diff images (diff labels), diff layer, diff models
-->
+) verifing CNN forgetting, proof
+) RNN forgetting, proof.
# what we gonna do:
what we gonna do to mitigate forgetting


## NOTE: from result of ContCapt S19 table D_frozen give better --> imply that decoder (free) cause forgetting more than encoder(free).
